### Troubleshouting

***1** Dropping of old database failed

If this message (
*SQL1035N  The operation failed because the specified database cannot be connected to in the mode requested.  SQLSTATE=57019*
) shows up after trying to drop the database there are ongoing connections to the database.

To solve this problem disconnect all clients from the database and try again.</br>
If you do not know the clients who are connected try to restart the whole service and force a disconnect on all connected clients.

***2** Connection on default port failed

If the connection fails on the default port the service is either not running or listening on a different port.

## Documentation

Documentation of the process and the overall concept of the information system.

### History

Here is the history of the different logical and physical models created with DbSchema listed.

##

**v_1** (logical only) *dropped*

Consists of the first data model which was only inspired by some screenshots. Therefore it was quickly out-of-date when the actual data was delivered.

##

**v_2**

v_5 has the views implemented
